collections in java
COllections are frameworks that provides architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects
WITH the help of COllections we can Perform operations like SEArching,Sorting,Insertion,Manipulation,Deletion
JaVa provides Interfaces like Set,list,queue,deque
classes like Arraylist,Vector,linkedlist,hashset,treeset,Priority Queue
interface:
public boolean add(E e)
Used to insert


BEFORE COLLECTIONS
to group java objects together only we had vector,array,hashtree
all three had no common interface
and vector is mostly final
Difficult to write algorithms


java.util.Collection
java.util.Map


Consistent API
Reduces programming effort
Increases speed


interface Collection<E>
E is type of objects that the collections will hold
Collections extends iterable interface


//methods


boolean add(E obj)
add obj to collecction
return true if objection was added
return false if obj is already a member of collection



boolean addAll(Collection <? extends E >c)

void clear()
Removes all elements from invoking collection


boolean contains(Objects obj)
boolean equals(Object obj)
boolean isEmpty()
Object[] toArray()



LIST interface
call get() -> index of object
call set() -> set a value to element 
indexOf()
subList()
add(int,E)


COLLECTION CLASSES

ArrayList :
uses dynamic array for storing elements
it inherits abstract List class and implements List interface
 
 can contain duplicate elements:
insertion order
random access
manipulation is slow
