enhance parallel processing,increase response to user,prioritize your work depending on priority,idle time of cpu
SYnchronized methods
Synchronized block
interthread Communication
When two or more threads need access to a shared resources,they need some way to ensure that resource will be used by only one thread at a time.
This process can be done by Synchronization

key to synchronisation is monitor.Monitor is a object that is used as a mutually exclusive lock.
communication:

wait() ->tells the calling thread to give up the monitor and go to sleep until some time notify()-> will wake up a thread that called wiat()
suspend,reusme()

Limitation of multithreading
data inconsistency,sharable data
register2 = counter
register2 = register2-1
counter = register2
Racce condition


setName
getName
public void run() start() stop()
